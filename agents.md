# Ulwazi Sphinx Theme - Agent Guide

## Project Overview

Ulwazi is a Sphinx theme based on Canonical's [Vanilla Framework](https://vanillaframework.io/).
It provides both generic Vanilla styling and Canonical-specific theming for documentation projects.

**Tech Stack**: Python, Sphinx, Jinja2, Vanilla Framework (SCSS), JavaScript
**License**: GPL-3.0
**Python**: >=`3.10` (`3.11` is recommended)

## Common Tasks

### Building

Build theme and docs:

```bash
make docs
```

Build theme and docs, and then run a local web server
(auto-rebuilds on content changes) to serve them:

```bash
make run
```

The web server will continue to run and publish the docs on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default.
To override: `make run SPHINX_HOST=0.0.0.0 SPHINX_PORT=8080`

To access the web pages served by web server, you'll need to keep the `make run` command running
and use a different terminal.

When all testing is done, don't forget to terminate the command serving the sample docs
to free up the address for publishing it next time. To terminate the command, use `CTRL+C`
in its terminal.

### Testing

```bash
make test              # Run fast tests only (excluding slow tests)
make test-fast         # Same as 'make test'
make test-slow         # Run slow tests only (PDF builds, browser checks)
make test-all          # Run all tests (fast and slow)
make test-python-versions  # Build theme and docs on every supported Python version (slow)
make test-coverage     # Run tests and generate coverage report
```

Available tests:

- **test_site_validation.py**: Validates built HTML for broken assets (missing CSS, JS, images)
- **test_pdf_generation.py**: Verifies PDF generation produces expected output file _(slow)_
- **test_scss_propagation.py**: Tests SCSS compilation and style propagation to rendered HTML using Playwright _(partially slow)_
- **test_python_versions.py**: Builds the theme and sample docs on every supported Python version _(slow)_

### Cleaning

Clean (delete) the built sample documentation content:

```bash
make docs-clean
```

Clean the built docs and theme files:

```bash
make clean
```

Rebuild theme and docs (combination of `clean` and `docs`):

```bash
make rebuild
```

### Styling

```bash
make npm-install  # Install Vanilla Framework modules
make vanilla-main # Compile SCSS to CSS
```

### Quick start

Prefer Makefile targets.
The `make docs` command creates the virtualenv and installs Python deps.

Install Node dependencies (only if you need to compile SCSS):

```bash
yarn install
```

**Node.js**: required only for SCSS compilation via `make vanilla-main` (uses npm).

## Key Files

- **[pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)**: Package metadata, dependencies, build config
- **[Makefile](Makefile)**: Build automation and common tasks
- **[ulwazi/**init**.py](ulwazi/**init**.py)**: Theme entry point, `_html_page_context` for HTML modification hooks
- **[ulwazi/theme/ulwazi/layout.html](ulwazi/theme/ulwazi/layout.html)**: Base page layout template

## Development Workflow

### Theme Changes

1. Modify files in [ulwazi/](ulwazi/) or [ulwazi/theme/ulwazi/](ulwazi/theme/ulwazi/)
2. Run `make rebuild` (theme changes require full rebuild)
3. Test in browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000

### Content Changes

- Sample docs in [docs/content/](docs/content/) auto-rebuilds with `make run`

### Dependency Changes

- Update [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)
- Run `make clean` then `make run` to rebuild venv

### HTML Modifications

- Override templates in [ulwazi/theme/ulwazi/](ulwazi/theme/ulwazi/)
- Modify `_html_page_context` function in [ulwazi/**init**.py](ulwazi/__init__.py) for pre-theme processing

### Testing

Clean up the old files:

```bash
make clean
```

Update the Vanilla Framework styles:

```bash
make vanilla-main
```

Build and serve the theme and the sample docs:

```bash
make run
```

While the last command is running, access the default address in
another terminal to check the results manually.

When all testing is done, make sure to terminate the `make run` command in the original terminal.

Run tests to avoid regression:

```bash
make test         # fast tests only
make test-all     # all tests (fast and slow, including PDF and Python version tests)
```

## Code Conventions

### Python

- Follow PEP 8
- Type hints where possible
- BeautifulSoup4 for HTML manipulation
- Use Sphinx extension hooks in `__init__.py`

### Templates (Jinja2)

- Located in [ulwazi/theme/ulwazi/](ulwazi/theme/ulwazi/)
- Use `{{ }}` for expressions, `{% %}` for statements
- Inherit from base templates using `{% extends %}`

### Styles

- [Vanilla Framework](https://vanillaframework.io/) for base styles
- SCSS source in [ulwazi/theme/ulwazi/assets/](ulwazi/theme/ulwazi/assets/)
- Compiled CSS in [ulwazi/theme/ulwazi/static/](ulwazi/theme/ulwazi/static/)

## Important Notes

- **Virtual Environment**: Located at `.venv/`, managed automatically by Make
- **Build Artifacts**: `build/`, `*.egg-info/`, `.venv/`, `docs/_build/` are gitignored
- **Node Modules**: Required for Vanilla Framework compilation
- **Auto-rebuild**: `make run` watches content changes but NOT theme changes

## Testing Locations

- **Sample docs**: [docs/](docs/) - comprehensive test content
- **Cheatsheet pages**: [docs/content/rst-cheat-sheet.rst](docs/content/rst-cheat-sheet.rst) and [docs/content/myst-cheat-sheet.md](docs/content/myst-cheat-sheet.md) - comprehensive examples of all supported blocks (admonitions, code blocks, tables, etc.). Use these to verify theme rendering. When adding new features, update both cheatsheets with equivalent examples in similar structure.
- **Test scripts**: [tests/](tests/) - validation, PDF generation, SCSS propagation, and Python version compatibility tests
- **Tests documentation**: [docs/content/tests/](docs/content/tests/) - documentation for the test suite, including [Python version compatibility](docs/content/tests/python-versions.md)
- **Built output**: [docs/\_build/](docs/_build/) - inspect generated HTML

## Syntax

Sample docs use MyST Markdown syntax most of the time, with specific pages, like RST cheat sheet, using reStructuredText.

### Formatting Conventions

When editing documentation or markdown files:

- Make sure there is a blank line after headings before content
- Make sure there is a blank line before lists (bullet or numbered)
- Use MyST Markdown for new content unless RST-specific features are required
- Keep examples in cheat sheets structurally parallel between MyST and RST versions
